### Tutorial

A full tutorial where the game is built from scratch is available [here](https://github.com/a327ex/blog/issues/30). This tutorial goes over the entire process of building the game step by step. The `tutorial` folder in this repository also contains the necessary files to follow along with the tutorial as well as answers to exercises (look into them only after really trying to answer!).

Sound assets from freesounds.org are probably CC0 or CC-BY-3.0. The site allows CC-BY-NC-3.0 but it seems unlikely the commercial game included any of those. Given that the sounds have probably been converted to ogg and all have been renamed it would be difficult to track down the originals.
